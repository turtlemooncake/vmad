# Italy Pixels

For seven days in January, I went on vacation in Italy. Alongside me were my parents and brother, though we travelled there separately. This would be their first time on the European continent. My mom, a big fan of European desserts and architecture, was super looking forward to finally seeing what the real deal was all about. Before our travel day, we watched the 2004 classic _EuroTrip_ to get in the right state of mind.

Italy wasn't a random choice. My brother was studying abroad at the Università di Bologna for the spring semester and my parents decided we should all go to "settle him in." We had about two days of overlap before his program started, and then it was hasta la vistsa. Using Bologna as our base camp, we took day trips to various cities in the region.
