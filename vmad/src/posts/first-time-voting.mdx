# My First Time Voting

## Feb 11, 2026

<br />

I grew up in Wisconsin. Pundits and news analysts dub the state as part of the
“Blue Wall” that democrats have built over the years. We only host 10 electoral
votes, but we’re still considered a swing state.

My first time voting was in the 2018 midterm elections. On the senate level,
Tammy Baldwin, the incumbent senator and also an alumni of my highschool, was on
the ballot alongside a handful of school board positions, state legislatures,
and a tight two-person race for Governor. Other than Baldwin, the rest of the
names were foreign to me. I had never seen them anywhere on the news or on
social media. I vividly remember frantically googling all the names on my phone
on the way to my neighborhood’s polling station. The 2018 midterms were marketed
mainly for senate and house seats, but that year a significant number of local
leadership positions were also at stake. There were people running for racial
diversity, closing the achievement gap, proliferating environmental measures for
schools, and more.

When I arrived at the polling station, the first thing I noticed was the
overwhelming majority of elderly volunteers compared to youth volunteers. From
the ladies manning the front desk to the people at the sticker table in the
back, almost everyone working the polls were over the age of fifty.

The process of voting itself was surprisingly simple. Not too dissimilar to a
multiple choice test, all that was required was a fill-in of different bubbles
by the candidates’ names. Each name had the candidate’s party affiliation beside
it in parentheses, so I guess even under circumstances in which one came to the
polling site unprepared, there is still a rough guideline on which candidate to
choose. In part because the actual selection is so simple, I checked over my
ballot at least three times just to make sure I had everything filled out
correctly. Once I filled out my form and quadruple checked all of my choices, I
entered a second line to turn in the ballot. At my location, they have a huge
plastic machine box that eats up your ballot like a copy printer.

In-person voting itself is simple and efficient. I now live in Seattle, where
the de-factor is mail-in ballots; the process here is even simpler! The actions
that need to take place beforehand however, are anything but easy. Even if you
are a person in possession of free time and of sufficient wealth, the voting
process may still be cumbersome depending on the location of your polling
station, the size of the line, and as the 2020 presidential election has shown
us, counter protesters intent on disrupting the process. It is clear that the
American voting system is in need of reform, but ironically the action needed to
initiate change starts with citizen voting.
