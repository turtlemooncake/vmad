# Religions and The Flood

## Feb 12, 2026

<br />

In Chinese mythology, it is said that after the sky fractured and unleashed a
torrential flood, it was the goddess Nuwa who mended the pieces and brought back
mankind. Ovid’s Metamorphoses describes the events and aftermath of Jove’s
Flood. Other accounts, such as the Bible and The Epic of Gilgamesh, also reviews
the progression to and from a Flood.

The fallacies of mankind’s own nature prompt divine punishment in all three
stories. While the two Near East myths generalize larger populations – from
inhabitants of a city to all humans on Earth – the Greek tale specifically only
follows Lycaon. Regardless of how many people commit sinful acts, each story
follows up with punishment from divine forces. One could generalize that it was
actually the disloyalty of humans that angered the gods.

The Jewish Bible states in its first commandment to be loyal only to the one
true God. In Greek mythology, the gods punish heroes such as Odysseus and
Achilles for disloyal actions. The retraction of a Flood concurs side-along with
evidence of mankind’s return or increased piousness. Deucalion and Pyrrha prayed
to Themis and believed her prophecy, and the protagonists of Genesis and The
Epic of Gilgamesh made material sacrifices to the gods. All three myths end in
the protagonists gaining an increased awareness of their relationship with
divine forces, thus enabling it possible for future generations to retain
piousness.

The endings of the stories however, diverge in path. In both Genesis and The
Epic of Gilgamesh it is described that after witnessing man’s sacrifice of
material possessions, the gods make a promise never to release the Flood again.
Besides Themis’s intervention, the Greek gods make no mention of any future
promises to prevent another Flood. There is no long-term commitment that the
gods won’t cause another catastrophic event.

Anyways, I don't know where I was going with this.
