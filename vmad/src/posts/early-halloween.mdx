# College Hauntings

## Feb 10, 2026

<br />
It was on a chilly Thursday night after a club meeting that my friend and I
stumbled upon a cult. Seven or eight black hooded figures stood huddled in an
alleyway off The Range; each one sported a white mask that completely covered
their face. Their almost archaic clothing was a stand out against the modern
buses rolling through McCormick Road. We stopped, panicked, and bolted down the
street back to dorms.

I later learned that the people we saw were mostly likely a part of the
Purple-Hooded secret society, but at that moment it seemed that I was witnessing
something occult. The University of Virginia has a history of superstitious
sites and haunted dwellings. One of its most famous students, Edgar Allen Poe,
became famous for his methods of crafting a supernatural story. Poe’s techniques
however, are by no means the standard for writing a paranormal plot. Whether it
be my own experiences, or Shirley Jackson’s style of building a story, there are
multiple different ways that can make a story seem supernatural.
